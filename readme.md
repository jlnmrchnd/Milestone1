# UX DESIGN:  
A mobile-first approach was taken:  
* Title Logo occupies full width
* Nav Bar sits beneath logo, not alongside
* Homepage with large, square boxes which sit comfortably in 2 or even 1 column
* Site expands to desktop view easily
* Challenge with collapsing margins leaving 'Sign up' buttons hidden behind / on top of other content
