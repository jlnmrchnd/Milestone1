            <br>
            <p>Here at the Bark Side we hope to provide information and relevant details about owning your own pet - whether a more traditional pet such as a cat, dog, rabbit, guinea pig or hamster, or those more outlandish choices such as fish, birds, spiders or snakes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should find helpful hints, links to relevant services outside the scope of this site, and some pictures to help guide your choice</p>
            <br>
            <p>So let's begin your search for the perfect house pet! Alternatively, stay up to date with the latest from The Bark Side by clicking on the button:</p>
